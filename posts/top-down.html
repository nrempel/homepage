        <i>I came across this article that I wrote a few years back and enjoyed reading it again so I thought I would throw it up here on my new site. If you have an opinion, I'd love to hear it!</i>

      <h1>Writing Software From the Top-Down</h1>
      <time datetime="February 27, 2017">

      <p>
        After a few years of writing software, I've settled on one thought process for planning what I create.  Whether I'm building a customer facing feature or a command-line utility, I start by thinking about the end-user experience.  
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two angles to take when writing software:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Bottom-up</span> - determine the technical requirements first; then, build an experience around that framework
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Top-down</span> - plan the experience <i>assuming anything is possible</i> and consider the low-level details afterwards
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Bottom-up Thinking Trap</h2>

      <p>
        When I'm planning something out, it's easy to fall into the trap of bottom up thinking.  My first inclination as a programmer is to figure out all of the details of what I'm going to implement and write them down.  I might ask myself several questions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do I need a new data model for this feature?</li>
        <li>Do I need to manipulate any existing data models in new ways?</li>
        <li>Is what I'm trying to accomplish feasible on a large data set?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Starting with this type of thinking is a trap.   Once I've finished putting up constraints based on technical limitations, what I'm left to work with is much less creative.
      </p>

      <p>Consider the following approach:</p>

      <h2>The Top-down Approach</h2>

      <p>
        I assume anything is possible.  I talk to friends, colleagues, and strangers and ask what kind of experience they would expect. I draw out the flow of the feature on paper.  I mockup and animate the feature and ask for more feedback then iterate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once I've nailed down the final experience, I figure out what it takes to make it work.  This might be much more difficult and I might need to make some compromises, but the end result is much more satisfying.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Maybe this is obvious to others but I often fall into the trap of bottom-up thinking.  I find myself writing software and thinking about the requirements first, then building an experience around that.  Whenever I notice myself thinking this way, I flip it upside down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether I'm building a shed, writing a new feature for a web product, or planning a trip, I take the top-down approach when creating something great.
