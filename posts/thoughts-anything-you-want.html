      <p>
        Anything You Want is a super concise book filled with lots of knowledge. I agree with almost everything in this book and I’m inspired by Derek’s success as an entrepreneur. I’m especially inspired by the fact that he was able to grow a business so naturally. He didn’t focus on raising money from investors or writing long business plans, he stumbled across a niche market and focused on the customers and everything else fell into place.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the lessons is titled “Act like you don’t need the money.” Here it is:
      </p>

      <blockquote cite="https://sivers.org/dontneed">
        <p>
          Banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record
          labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. People
          fall in love with people who won’t give them the time of day. It’s
          a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you set up your business like you don’t need the money,
          people are happier to pay you. When someone’s doing something
          for the money, people can sense it, like they sense a desperate
          lover. It’s a turnoff. When someone's doing something for love,
          being generous instead of stingy, trusting instead of fearful, it
          triggers this law: We want to give to those who give.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s another Tao of business: Set up your business like you
          don’t need the money, and it’ll likely come your way.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This makes perfect sense and I agree with it but I’m scratching my head about how to actually go about doing this. If I’m acting like I don’t need the money, do I not do any marketing? On a marketing website, should the pricing and “buy now” links not be advertised on the front page? If anyone has any insight on how to accomplish this while actually making sales please let me know.
