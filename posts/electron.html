        I recently read <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/">Electron is flash for the desktop</a>. The author takes an entirely negative perspective on the comparison and I’d like to offer an alternate one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s the thing: Flash wasn't bad for the web at all – it did amazing things. It democratized access to publishing creative works on the internet, creating and publishing games, and designing media-rich websites. How is that a bad thing? I spent a lot of time on <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/">newgrounds.com</a> when I was younger where I played games and watched cartoons that my peers created and I created content myself. That’s an amazing thing!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, the internet outgrew the Flash platform but that doesn’t mean it didn’t do great things for the web and software. Yes, it was clunky, It drained battery on mobile devices, and it had security issues which led Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously leave out Flash support on its mobile devices</a>. Flash had its fair share of problems but these issues are a pretty small price to pay in exchange for the progress that made on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Electron, we’re seeing a similar explosion of new desktop software. The lower barrier to entry into creating cross platform desktop software <span class="italic">far</span> outweighs the detriment of computer resource usage. A good friend of mine is able to successfully <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">launch and grow a business</a> as a solo bootstrapped founder in part because of this lower barrier. Yes, Electron has some bloat and is not well suited for many cases; but, is that really an issue compared to the benefit of this creative flood of great new software? Just as Flash carved a path for modern open web technologies, Electron will clear a path for more accessible desktop software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m all for comparing Electron with Flash but let’s compare them for what they are: great.
