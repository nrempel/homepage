      <p>
        These days, there are so many ways <span class="italic">not</span> to cook your own meals, sometimes I wonder if the act of cooking is becoming a thing of the past. On one side of the spectrum, we have products like Soylent which act as a meal replacement. On the other side, we have a plethora of companies all vying for top contender in the food delivery space and itâ€™s a <a href="http://www.eater.com/2016/6/14/11933880/online-food-delivery-market-data-grubhub">big industry</a>! Now you can even have <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/18/14306674/starship-robot-food-delivery-washington-dc-silicon-valley">robots</a> delivery your food to you. ðŸ¤”
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, Iâ€™m not hating on convenient food options. Iâ€™ve drank my fair share of  Soylent, I get my food delivered to me sometimes, I do eat out occasionally, and Iâ€™m very grateful to have the ability to do so. These services are convenient and, some days, I donâ€™t think I would be able to find the time to prepare meals without them. All that said, I think that itâ€™s important to make these quicker meal options supplemental to cooking that you do at home. There is some intrinsic value in cooking for yourself, especially if youâ€™re cooking with family, friends, or a partner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently Iâ€™ve challenged myself to cook at home much more and Iâ€™ve discovered that cooking the majority of my own meals in the midst of a work week is actually <span class="italic">really fucking hard!</span> There are some good tricks that make it easier but learning those takes some time. If you werenâ€™t thinking much about cooking before (as I wasnâ€™t), it can be difficult to carve enough mindshare to dedicate to the kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cooking at home costs less (although you spend more time doing it) and it is generally healthier for you. But I think the biggest benefit to preparing your own meals is that cooking and eating together with friends, family, and community is good for the soul. Itâ€™s not something that is easily measured; still, the value of celebrating food is undeniable.
