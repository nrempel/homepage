      <p>
        Hi there! Here, I share what I'm working on and thoughts that I want to share. I enjoy participating in discussion on Twitter so please tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/nbrempel" title="Nicholas Rempel's Twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a> at me. You can also send me a message <a href="mailto:nbrempel@gmail.com" title="Nicholas Rempel's Email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a> by email which I promise to respond to.
      </p>
      <h2>Main Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, most of my time is spent working on <a href="http://servmetrics.com">Servmetrics</a> which is a company that I started with 3 others. There, I act as the head of software development.
      </p>
      <h2>Other Work</h2>
      <p>
        There are a handful of other active projects that I've worked on in the past or that I occasionally work on in my spare time:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://pressites.com">Pressites</a> is a simple and shareable press release creator and hosting service. It was a fun project with the goal of automating a lot of the work done by <a href="http://www.thepresswriters.com/">The Press Writers</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://bustaprice.com">Bustaprice</a> is a price comparison search engine. Many price comparison search sites have been around for over a decade and lack a modern experience. I wanted to see if I could create a similar price comparison site with a better experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://sitemapper.co">Sitemapper</a> is an SEO toolkit that is currently under development. There seems to be a lot of demand for SEO optimization tools and yet the landscape is littered with old and badly designed products. I hope Sitemapper can fill some of the gaps that exist.
      </p>
